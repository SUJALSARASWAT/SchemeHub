AI-based Identification of Financial Needs

Overview

Team Tensor proposes an AI-powered system for India Post that dynamically identifies and predicts customer needs for financial services (banking & insurance) based on demographic information (e.g., age, caste, occupation) and economic cycles (e.g., farming seasons, income variation). This system aims to provide targeted, timely, and personalized banking and insurance services to enhance customer engagement and service efficiency.
Features

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Uses demographic data and seasonal/farming cycle data. Includes handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and splitting data for training.
Predictive Modeling: Combines multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM, using a Voting Regressor to predict customer needs.
Recommendation Engine: Personalized financial and insurance schemes based on the customerâ€™s demographic and seasonal data.
Time-based Recommendations: Adjusts recommendations according to economic cycles to ensure timely relevance.
Handling Unseen Data: Custom fallback mechanism to handle new or unseen values in categorical fields.
Technologies Used

Languages: Python, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas
Cloud & Deployment: AWS, Docker, Flask/FastAPI
Hardware: GPUs, High-Performance Servers
Workflow
