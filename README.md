# AI-based Identification of Financial Needs

## Overview
**Team Tensor** proposes an AI-powered system for India Post that dynamically identifies and predicts customer needs for financial services (banking & insurance) based on demographic information (e.g., age, caste, occupation) and economic cycles (e.g., farming seasons, income variation). This system aims to provide targeted, timely, and personalized banking and insurance services to enhance customer engagement and service efficiency.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: 
    - Uses demographic data (age, caste, occupation, income level, etc.) and seasonal/farming cycle data.
    - Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical data (using One-Hot Encoding), and scaling features (using MinMaxScaler).
    - Data is split into training and testing sets for model development.

- **Predictive Modeling**: 
    - Machine learning models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
    - These models are combined using a Voting Regressor to predict customer financial needs.

- **Recommendation Engine**:
    - The system takes demographic and seasonal details to predict the likelihood of needing specific financial or insurance services.
    - Provides personalized recommendations based on these predictions.

- **Time-based Recommendations**: 
    - Adapts recommendations dynamically based on seasonal data, ensuring that they are timely and relevant.

- **Handling Unseen Data**: 
    - Efficient handling of new/unseen values in categorical fields through a custom fallback mechanism.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS, Docker, Flask/FastAPI
- **Hardware**: GPUs, High-Performance Servers

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
    - Collect demographic, economic, and seasonal data.
    - Clean and preprocess data using techniques like encoding and feature scaling.

2. **Model Development**:
    - Train machine learning models (LSTM, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for predicting customer needs.
    - Combine models using a Voting Regressor to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy a real-time prediction solution using Flask on AWS/GCP.

4. **Integration**:
    - Seamlessly integrate the system with India Postâ€™s existing infrastructure to provide personalized financial services.

5. **Monitoring**:
    - Continuously monitor model performance and retrain with updated data to maintain accuracy.

## Impact & Benefits
- **Customer Engagement**: Personalized financial services lead to higher customer engagement.
- **Service Efficiency**: Timely and relevant service recommendations improve operational efficiency.
- **Financial Inclusion**: The system enhances financial inclusion, especially in underserved and rural areas.
- **Sustainability**: Helps India Post achieve long-term growth and sustainability by providing better-targeted services.
